# VLOOKUP
V stands for vertical, which it is been used to look up information organized in vertical columns or join information from two tables. The easiest way to understand this function is to look at an example.

In this project, I used it easy to find customer info in Excel using VLOOKUP. When you type in a customer's ID, VLOOKUP quickly grabs details like their contact person, department, and region from a list. This helped a lot because it's faster than searching manually and saved time. The filed for this project was uploaded.
